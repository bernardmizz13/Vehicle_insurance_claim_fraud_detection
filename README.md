# Vehicle_insurance_claim_fraud_detection

In this project, we aim to to identify fraudulent vehicle insurance claims.

We retrieve the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/vehicle-claim-fraud-detection. This same data was also partially used in the article found in https://blogs.oracle.com/machinelearning/post/a-two-step-process-for-detecting-fraud-using-oracle-machine-learning.

Research papers which also used this data were https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhuo-Jin-3/publication/353212085_Insurance_Fraud_Detection_with_Unsupervised_Deep_Learning/links/60ed66449541032c6d36fa0f/Insurance-Fraud-Detection-with-Unsupervised-Deep-Learning.pdf and https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen-Okeno/publication/354683668_A_FEDERATED_MODEL_FOR_INSURANCE_CLAIMS_FRAUD_DETECTION/links/61463f523c6cb310697a3397/A-FEDERATED-MODEL-FOR-INSURANCE-CLAIMS-FRAUD-DETECTION.pdf.
